Banking Calculator
Overview
The Banking Calculator is designed to assist users in estimating the future value of their investment accounts over a specified period. This program calculates the future value of an investment account with or without additional monthly deposits, based on user input for initial investment, monthly deposits, annual interest rate, and number of years. It offers two calculation scenarios: one without additional monthly deposits and the other with additional monthly deposits.
The program prompts users to input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit amount, annual interest rate, and the number of years for which they want to calculate the future value. Based on this input, it generates a detailed report showing the year-end balance and earned interest for each year.
