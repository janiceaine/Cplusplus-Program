# Cplusplus-Program
The Banking Calculator is designed to assist users in estimating the future value of their investment accounts over a specified period. This program calculates the future value of an investment account with or without additional monthly deposits, based on user input for initial investment, monthly deposits, annual interest rate, and number of years. It offers two calculation scenarios: one without additional monthly deposits and the other with additional monthly deposits.
The program prompts users to input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit amount, annual interest rate, and the number of years for which they want to calculate the future value. Based on this input, it generates a detailed report showing the year-end balance and earned interest for each year.

Installation 
To run the program, follow these steps:
-	Clone this repository to your local machine.
-	Open the project in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
-	Build and run the program.
Usage 
Upon running the program, users will be prompted to enter the following information:
-	Initial investment amount
-	Monthly deposit amount
-	Annual interest rate (in percentage)
-	Number of years for the investment
After providing the required input, the program will generate a report displaying the year-end balance and earned interest for each year, both with and without additional monthly deposits.   

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
• Particularly Well-Done: The code's structure and organization were one area of the project where I think I excelled. The banking calculator's functionality was made more modular and easier to maintain by using a class-based approach to encapsulate related data and operations.
• Areas for Improvement: The code works as intended, although a few places may use improvement. For instance, input validation might be enhanced to more graciously manage user-inputted erroneous data, displaying helpful error messages and encouraging the user to enter accurate data. To manage unforeseen runtime failures and provide a better user experience, error-handling methods could also be put in place.
• Challenging Pieces of Code: Implementing the logic to determine the year-end balance and earned interest for each year was one of the most difficult aspects of the code, particularly when taking into account the scenario with additional monthly contributions. The solution to this problem was to thoroughly plan and test the calculation process and to seek advice from online forums and manuals, among other resources.
• Transferable Skills: Skills gained from this project, such as object-oriented programming principles, input validation, error handling, and modular code design, will be highly transferable to other projects and coursework. These skills are fundamental to software development and will be applicable in various programming scenarios.
